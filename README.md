# comp-phys

This is a physics simulation of massive bodies under the influence of gravity, written in Common Lisp.
Plots are ouput by interfacing with gnuplot with the help of vgplot (https://github.com/volkers/vgplot). 
Vector mathematics are handled using rtg-math (https://github.com/cbaggers/rtg-math/).
Also used is iterate (https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/iterate/iterate).
